# Infinite
UNDER CONSTRUCTION  
I've long admired the format of leftasrain.com and wanted to build something similar. I'm finally setting out to do that.

## Setup Instructions:
Rename *config_example.js* to *config.js*  
The *sessionSecret* variable must contain a random string within quotes  
Set the *mongoUri* variable to point to your instance of mongodb. This URI string should contain your database credentials if needed.
Navigate to the download location in your terminal and type *npm run go*
